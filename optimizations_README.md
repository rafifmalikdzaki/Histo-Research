- Implemented dynamic batch size detection
- Added gradient checkpointing for memory efficiency
- Used mixed precision training

**Files**: `pl_training_optimized.py`

**Expected Improvement**: 1.5-2x overall training speedup

### 4. Optimized Data Pipeline

**Problem**: Small batch sizes and inefficient data loading underutilized GPU.

**Solution**:
- Implemented automatic batch size detection based on GPU memory
- Increased default batch sizes
- Added persistent workers and prefetching
- Enabled cuDNN benchmark for consistent input sizes

**Files**: `pl_training_optimized.py:91-120`

**Expected Improvement**: Better GPU utilization and throughput

### 5. Architecture Improvements

**Problem**: Inefficient tensor operations and memory layout.

**Solution**:
- Flattened spline weights for better memory access patterns

## üîç Key Technical Improvements

### B-spline Optimization
```python
# Before: Loop-based computation
for k in range(1, self.spline_order + 1):
    bases = ... # Sequential operations

# After: Vectorized computation
bases = ((x_expanded >= grid[:-1]) & (x_expanded < grid[1:])).float()
for k in range(1, self.spline_order + 1):
    bases = left_term + right_term  # Fully vectorized
```

### Convolution Optimization
```python
# Before: Nested loops
for ch in range(channels):
    for kh in range(kernel_size):
        for kw in range(kernel_size):
            # Process individual elements

# After: Batch operations
spline_output_flat = torch.einsum('bpf,opf->bpo', spline_bases, spline_weights)
```

### Memory Management
```python
# Before: Frequent cache clearing
if batch_idx % 10 == 0:
    torch.cuda.empty_cache()

# After: Optimized memory management
if batch_idx % 50 == 0:
    torch.cuda.empty_cache()
```
