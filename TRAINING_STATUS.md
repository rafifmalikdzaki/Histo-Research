# Training Status Update

## Current Status: ✅ TRAINING WORKING

The DAE-KAN training script is now working properly with automatic analysis temporarily disabled.

### What's Working:
- **Training progresses normally** without errors
- **Basic metrics tracking** (Loss, SSIM)
- **W&B integration** for remote monitoring
- **Good performance**: ~13 it/s, stable training
- **Model learning**: Loss ↓ 0.44→0.006, SSIM ↑ -0.03→0.90

### Issue Identified:
The automatic analysis system has hook setup issues causing "too many values to unpack" errors. This is due to incorrect model reference in the attention hooks.

### Files Modified:
- `src/pl_training_streamlined.py` - Temporarily disabled automatic analysis
- `src/analysis/auto_analysis.py` - Added model fallback handling

### Next Steps to Fix Analysis:

1. **Fix Hook Setup** (Priority 1):
   ```python
   # The issue is that auto_analysis is calling self.model but needs self.model.model
   # Update the hook registration to properly reference the DAE_KAN_Attention layers
   ```

2. **Test Hooks Separately** (Priority 2):
   ```bash
   python -c "
   from models.model import DAE_KAN_Attention
   model = DAE_KAN_Attention()
   # Test accessing BAM layers
   print(model.bottleneck.attn1)
   print(model.bottleneck.attn2)
   "
   ```

3. **Re-enable Analysis** (Priority 3):
   ```python
   # Uncomment the analysis blocks in pl_training_streamlined.py after hooks are fixed
   ```

### Training Command (Current):
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python src/pl_training_streamlined.py --project-name histopath-kan-analysis --batch-size 4
```
